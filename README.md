# Prox Spray

Prox Spray is a powerful tool that allows you to check if you can proxy through common ports on a web application while testing. By scanning for open ports commonly used for proxying, Prox Spray helps identify potential vulnerabilities and access restricted resources within the scope of your penetration test.

## Key Features

- **Port Scanning:** Prox Spray performs a port scan on the target web application, checking for open ports such as 80, 443, 8080, and 8443.
- **Proxy Testing:** It enables you to test if you can successfully proxy through the identified open ports, providing valuable insights into potential security weaknesses.
- **Scope Expansion:** By leveraging the ability to proxy through specific resources, Prox Spray uncovers alternative routes to access resources that may be blocked within the defined scope of your penetration test.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Prox Spray allows you to customize the target URLs, ports to scan, and request headers for proxy testing, offering flexibility to adapt to different testing scenarios.
- **Informative Reporting:** The tool generates detailed reports that include the scan results, proxy response codes, and other relevant information, facilitating thorough analysis and documentation of the testing process.

## Motivation

The motivation behind developing Prox Spray came from a real-life scenario where I discovered that a particular web application allowed proxying through specific resources. This realization emphasized the importance of testing for proxy vulnerabilities during penetration tests. Prox Spray was created to provide a streamlined and efficient way to identify such vulnerabilities and enhance the overall effectiveness of your penetration testing efforts.
